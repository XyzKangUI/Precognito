***Notice: Do not use this addon in combination with either HealBarsClassic or ClassicHealPrediction*** 

The addon adds the following Retail functions to Wrath Classic:

- Instant Health Updates
- Incoming Heals
- Shield Absorb (powered by AbsorbMonitor lib)
- Shows power cost and when you cap rage/energy/focus in combat.

The initial idea was given to me by a 3.3.5 player who was using [UnitFrameLayers](https://github.com/RomanSpector/UnitFrameLayers)
